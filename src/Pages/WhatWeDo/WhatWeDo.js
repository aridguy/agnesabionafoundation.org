                                <p>
                                    AAF is guided by the principle that education is basic human right and all children must have
                                    access and also believe that it is one of the veritable empowerment tools against poverty.
                                    Education of girls from poor family background is a challenge. AAF provide education support
                                    for these girls since they are the group that are likely to be deprived of this right on
                                    account of their entrenched poverty and marginalized social status. AAF provide for
                                    girls from the poor family background essential school needs such as uniforms, school
                                    and examination fees, shoes, books and stationery. This support is vital to forestall
                                    these girls drop out of school to prevent them being taken low paid employment job in
                                    exploitative condition or resort to paid sex with older men in order to continue
                                    their education at the cost of their lives in the long term.
                                    Our approach for selection of girls for education support is
                                    based solely on need and not on academic performance.
                                    This is done through information received from our community
                                    partners and investigated by our staff to identify girls who are at the risk of dropping
                                    out of school due to poverty. If these girls are deprived of education, they may face early
                                    marriage or migrating to cities to work as a child labourers where they are often exploited.

                                <p>
                                    As girls navigate adolescent stage, they face challenge of moving through physical,
                                    psychological, sexual, and emotional development with a healthy sense of self intact.
                                    A mentor at this stage of girlâ€™s life can have an impact in successfully navigating
                                    the years to adulthood.
                                    AAF believe that mentorship should start as early as in the middle secondary
                                    school when girls are starting to form opinion about the world around them and what
                                    to do in the future. This is very important especially with the girls from poor
                                    background who lack the privileged others have to network with successful
                                    individuals who can help them start their careers on the right path. Mentors
                                    are very important in levelling the playing field for girls of all backgrounds
                                    and bridge the gender gap that keeps so many young women from reaching up the
                                    career ladder. From the experience, irrespective of your background and
                                    education attainment, the sooner girls are exposed to and have a chance
                                    to learn from positive female role models across a variety of roles and
                                    fields the better they think limitlessly about their future and able
                                    to tackle the obstacles they encounter along their career path in life.
